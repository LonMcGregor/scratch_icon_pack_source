LonM's Honest Winter Icon Pack
========================

This is LonM's Honest Winter icon Pack.

Made for personal use primarily,  you are welcome to use it yourself if you so wish.

This has only been tested with Teslacoil's Nova Launcher, on CyanogenMod 11.

Also note that the some of the icons are not changed from those provided by default. I.e. I did not create them myself, and as such they are still under copyright of the original owners.

This was originally a fork from iamareebjamal/scratch_icon_pack_source.
